# odin-recipes

This is a simple project that displays a list of recipes. The recipes link to their own page when clicked. 

All the recipe pages have the same struture: name, picture, description, unordered list of ingredients, and ordered list of steps to follow. They also have a link back to the Home page.

I learned about HTML tags, boilerplate, working with text like headings and paragraphs, both ordered and unordered lists, links to other pages and images, and commit messages.

All the recipe content (text and images) come from: https://www.allrecipes.com/
